When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If you want to work on your code from different computers, or if you're collaborating with other developers, having a remote repository is an easy way to keep everyone on the same page.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You want to make sure you're pulling at logical points.  If Git automatically updates then you might wipe out changes you were working on locally, or pull changes you were planning to delete/overwrite with a push later.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are like clones, but they only exist on GitHub.  Clones are copies of a repository.  They can be on GitHub on our your local computer.  Branches are when you want to have two separate repositories that share a parent, but maybe you want to try something experimental but don't want to change the 'master.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    So you can compare it with your local file and see if there are any differences.
