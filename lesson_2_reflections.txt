What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates a new git repository, but there are no commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is a holding place for files that are being worked on.  Once you commit, all the files in the staging area are committed together.  It's helpful when multiple files are logically linked, and may have changes that you want to commit at once (html and css)
